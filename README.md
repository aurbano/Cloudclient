Cloudclient
========

A web client for cloud services like Dropbox. It only supports Dropbox at the moment although I'd like to add more services like Box.com and Google Drive.

It works mainly in JavaScript, although it uses a PHP "proxy" to connect to the Dropbox API, mainly to simplify the process of OAuth
