Cloudclient
========

A web client for cloud services like Dropbox. It uses a PHP backend to interact with the Dropbox API, although it is JavaScript who does most of the work.

For the PHP part it uses the Dropbox-PHP API by Evert Pot (http://www.rooftopsolutions.nl/) with some modifications.

If you see anything wrong post an issue or feel free to fork the project!
